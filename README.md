# DNA-Sorting

## Algorithm for the solution (Divide and conquer algorithm)
### Inspiration taken from merge sort algorithm
- Sort each of the string 
- compare the sorted to the unsorted string
- check all index to find index that has different value after sorting
- the least number of change in position can be considered the most sorted string
